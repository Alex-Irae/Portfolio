        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Intern,</strong> Zen2050 (Paris) <em>(Summer 2022)</em><br><br>

                I had the opportunity to contribute to our mission of action toward during my internship at
                Zen2050Maintenant, a climate focused organization in Paris.
                Zen2050 is dedicated to addressing climate issues on a local scale within the
                Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne regions, particularly by promoting sustainable practices and educational
                activities. They focus on integrating climate initiatives into local community structures through
                projects like “thermal walks,” where members assess local buildings for heat loss to encourage energy
                efficiency, and educational partnerships with schools to teach students about the importance of reducing
                their carbon footprint​.
                <br> <br>
                As part of my role, I was involved in planning and organizing their annual exhibition event, a central
                part of Zen2050's outreach efforts. My primary responsibility was to design various interactive stands,
                with a focus on activities that would engage visitors and help them connect with Zen2050’s mission in a
                hands-on way. I brainstormed and implemented creative ideas, including eco-conscious games, an area for
                climate-themed painting, and other activities designed to be informative and fun. I also managed the
                budget for these stations, making sure each idea was feasible without exceeding our financial
                constraints.
                <br> <br>
                Overall, this experience allowed me to blend creativity with practical considerations, enhancing my
                ability to design impactful community events that support meaningful environmental goals.
