        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Research Intern, Genomics,</strong> BGI Genomics (Shenzhen) <em>(Spring 2025)</em><br><br>

                During my internship at BGI Shenzhen, I was given the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research in AI-driven genomics. 
                BGI  is one of the world's leading centers for genomic research and bioinformatics, 
                dedicated to advancing biotechnology, synthetic biology, and precision medicine. 
                The institute plays a key role in genome sequencing, bioengineering,
                and AI-driven innovations that push the boundaries of what is possible in life sciences.
                BGI’s research spans multiple fields, from human health and agricultural genomics to synthetic DNA design, 
                fostering cutting-edge advancements in biotechnology. Through its commitment to AI-integrated biological research,
                BGI is shaping the future of genomics by combining computational models with large-scale biological data, 
                making it a global leader in the intersection of artificial intelligence and life sciences.
                <br> <br>
                As part of my internship at BGI Shenzhen, I am contributing to the development of an AI-driven genome generation framework
                for bacteriophage synthesis. This project leverages large language models (LLMs)
                and multi-layer Transformer architectures to optimize the design and generation of synthetic DNA sequences.
                <br><br>
                A key aspect of my work involves designing feature representation methods for long genetic sequences,
                addressing challenges in handling complex genomic data. To improve processing efficiency,
                I implement evo/evo2 dimensionality reduction alongside block-learning strategies, 
                enabling the model to extract meaningful biological patterns while maintaining computational efficiency.
                <br><br>
                To enhance model interpretability, I integrate an explainability module using feature
                attribution techniques. This addition ensures greater transparency in how the 
                AI system generates DNA sequences, allowing for controlled adjustments in genome synthesis.
                <br><br>
                The final stage of my internship focuses on validating the proposed AI framework through
                real-world phage genome synthesis tests. This step ensures that the generated sequences
                align with biological viability, bridging AI-driven sequence design with practical applications
                in synthetic biology and genomics. My work contributes to advancing AI applications in bioinformatics,
                paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and controllable genome engineering techniques.

            <li>
                <strong>Intern,</strong> Zen2050 (Paris) <em>(Summer 2022)</em><br><br>

                I had the opportunity to contribute to our mission to raise the awareness and fight the climate during
                my internship at
                Zen2050Maintenant.
                Zen2050 is dedicated to addressing climate issues on a local scale within the
                Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne regions, particularly by promoting sustainable practices and educational
                activities. They focus on integrating climate initiatives into local community structures through
                projects like “thermal walks,” where members assess local buildings for heat loss to encourage energy
                efficiency, and educational partnerships with schools to teach students about the importance of reducing
                their carbon footprint​.
                <br> <br>
                As part of my role, I was involved in planning and organizing their annual exhibition event, a central
                part of Zen2050's outreach efforts. My primary responsibility was to design various interactive stands,
                with a focus on activities that would engage visitors and help them connect with Zen2050’s mission in a
                hands-on way. I brainstormed and implemented creative ideas, including eco-conscious games, an area for
                climate-themed painting, and other activities designed to be informative and fun. I also managed the
                budget for these stations, making sure each idea was feasible without exceeding our financial
                constraints.
                <br> <br>
                Overall, this experience allowed me to blend creativity with practical considerations, enhancing my
                ability to design impactful community events that support meaningful environmental goals.
