        <h1>My Education</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="description">
            <p> My academic journey has focused on combining engineering principles with medical technology, primarily
                through my Master’s in Medical Engineering at EPF Engineering School Paris. Here, I’ve built expertise
                in
                programming applied to medicine, tackling diverse problem-solving projects across courses and labs (see
                Project section). Two exchange programs at Tianjin University, in Intelligent Medical Engineering and
                Computer Science, further broadened my skills in healthcare technologies and intelligent systems.
                <br> <br>
                To deepen my knowledge, I’ve completed certifications, including Duke University’s Advanced Medical
                Neuroscience, Stanford’s Machine Learning Specialization, and DeepLearning.AI’s TensorFlow for AI. These
                experiences have given me a robust foundation in problem-solving, adaptability, and applied machine
                learning, preparing me to innovate in medical engineering.
