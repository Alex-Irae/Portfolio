                    Disease prediction algorithm üëÅ</strong> (Python)
                <a href="https://github.com/Alex-Irae/DiseasePrediction" target="_blank">üîó GitHub Link üîó</a><br>
                Built and trained an app powered by several machine learning models and a neural network to preditc a
                disease based on symptoms inputs.
                Using a combnination of XGBoost, SVM, Logistic regression and Random Forest algorithms to enhance data
                prediction on a side.
                Using a 5 layers neural network (relu, swish,relu,swish,softmax) to predict the disease on the other
                side (same goal, different means).
                Accuracy of 94.7% for the nneural network and 100% for the ensemble model(on test data).
                The neural network performs ebtter overall on user input thanks to its efficient generalisation
                Processing methods to clean and preprocess data, then train the model to predict the disease before
                prompting the user to enter his symptoms.

                    AI Text Summarization Project </strong> (Python)<br>
                Currently developing an AI system to summarize texts using PyTorch and Tensorflow to classify them
                into different categories, based on FengShenBang LLm.

                    Hand Movement Recognition üëÅ</strong> (MATLAB)<br>
                Developed a system to recognize hand movements for gesture-based control with data from flexion sensors.
                Used Matlab to train a DNN to recognize fexion pattern in the finger associated with a movement.

                Created an intelligent orthosis to track knee flexion and classify the flexions into different
                categories, allowing for personalized rehabilitation programs and real-time feedback for healthcare

                    Robot Stress Test üëÅ</strong> (CATIA)<br>
                Conducted stress testing on robotic designs to evaluate performance under load to evaluate its capacity
                to perform various tasks in different environments.
                Used CATIA v5 to model the robot and simulate the stress test.

                    Fire Propagation Simulation üëÅ</strong> (Java)<br>
                A simulation project demonstrating fire spread dynamics in a multiple virtual environment.
                First, you create an environment with different materials and then you can start the simulation.
                Changing the wind force, direction as the simulation progresses for a more realistic simulation.
