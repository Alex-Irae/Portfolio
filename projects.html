                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Created a multi-frame Java application using Swing/AWT for the user
                    interface<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Implemented a dynamic grid-based simulation system using JButtons for terrain
                    visualization<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Developed terrain generation algorithms with random distribution patterns<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Built a sophisticated wind system affecting fire propagation patterns<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <br>
                    Key Features:<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Terrain Types: Grass, forest, water, and urban areas<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Environmental Controls: Wind speed, direction, and fire ignition points<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Real-time Simulation and parameter adjustment<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <br>
                    Results:<br>
                    Successfully created a comprehensive fire spread simulation tool that allows users to:<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Model various environmental scenarios<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Study fire behavior under different conditions<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Analyze the impact of terrain types and weather conditions<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Visualize complex environmental interactions<br>

                    Robot Stress Test üëÅ</strong> (CATIA)<br><br>
                Conducted stress testing on robotic designs to evaluate performance under load to evaluate its capacity
                to perform various tasks in different environments.
                Used CATIA v5 to model the robot and simulate the stress test.
